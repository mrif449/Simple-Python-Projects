# Welcome to 1D Coding Benchmark Porgram.
The main purpose of developing this program is to check how fast your machine compiles the code.
After running this program, it will ask you to how many sample you want to run. Much sample will give you more accurate result but it will also cause much time.

If you don't have much time I will recomanned to run at least 3 samples, 5 is ideal and 7 is great if time doesn't matter.

It will give your every sample runtime and score. And finally it will output total time taken to run this benchmark, your cummulative benchmark score and how much proformace drops while running codes.

Lastly, although you can directly run this exe file I provided, But I will recommand to directly run the script in the terminal, I have tested I get 5 times less score on IDE(Visual Studio Code). If you don't know how to run Python script directly on terminal, you can watch my video.
